    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>There are many different kinds of surfers that look for many different types of waves. And more experienced surfers will go to more dangerous and beaches with bigger waves. When novice surfers will go to more safe beaches with smaller waves. Overall each beach has its own local surfers thatknow almost everything about the beavh including the swells and set changes. </p>

    <h2>Locals</h2>
    <p>Many beaches have a locals. These area group of people that all mainly know each other. They know all about the beach including where the bestplaceto catch the wave is and what time is the best to go and surf. But there arealso pros. These people can mainly go to any beach they please and betreated like a local instead of a non-local. Overall locals can either welcome non-locals or can be rude and disrespectful and unwelcoming to the non-locals. This is very uncommon but can happen at certain beached. Over locals mainly keep to their group and dont really mind non-locals but there is always that chance.</p>

    <h2>Professionals</h2>
    <p>Pro surfers dont really surf in southern California due to the smaller waves and smaller swells. The only beach that pros go to in southern California is mainly the wedge. This is because it is mainly the only beach with big waves in this area. Pro's usually surf in other countries or states, for example some of the best waves in the world are in Hawaii. But some countries that have amazing waves are Figi, Indoniesia, and Ireland. These countries especially Indoniesia are use to many pro surfers coming and going. </p>
