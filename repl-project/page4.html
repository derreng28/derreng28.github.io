    <h2>What boards to use at certain beaches.</h2>
    <p><ul>
  <li>The Wedge-Here you would want to use either a bodyboard, skimboard, or a short surf board. Any bodyboard and skimboard would work but a surf board is way more complicated. The most popular surf board for this beach is probably a 6ft soft top surf baord.</li>
  <li>Blacks-This beach is complicated since it is mainly for experienced surfers. So I would suggest again any bodyboard since it doesnt really matter. But for the surf board I would suggest that you use a 6.5ft fiberglass board. This is so you can better maneuver the waves which will make you ride a lot easier.</li>
  <li>Sandspit-This beach has a vrery complicated break. For it has a really big backwash which can really hurt. This makes your board choice very important. But like the other beaches the skimboard and the bodyboard dont matter. Sice you can use any size and you will be fine. But for the surf board you would want to ride a smaller board for more control and overall an easier ride.</li>
  <li>Del Mar 15th Street-This beach is very good. For it can have many different waves. One day it can have 6ft barrels and the next you can have 3ft barrleless waves. Overall skimboarders can't really skim here but bodyboarders can ride. And for surfer the 2 boards that I would recomend would be a 8ft fiberglass and a 5.5ft soft top.</li>
  <li>Torrey Pines-This beach is very similiar to Del Mar 15th Street so you can use the same waves as Del Mar.</li>
  <li>Marine Street-Since this beach is just like the wedge I would suggest the same baords you would use at the wedge.</li>
  <li>Grandview-This beach you can use pretty much any surf bard but I would suggest a 7.5ft fiberglass longboard. This is because these waves you don't need a lot of maneuvering and that works for a 7.5ft board. For skimboards this beach is not welcoming since the waves break farther out making it hard to catch a wave. But bodyboarding works with any size at this beach.</li>
  <li>D street-This beach is just like Grandview so whatever boards you would use at grandview would work amazingly here.</li>
  <li>Big Rock-This beach is just like sandspit so whatever boards you would use at big rock you would use here and they would work amazingly.</li>
</ul></p>

    <h2>Why smaller surf boards are better</h2>
    <p>Surf boards are very simple yet complicated. There distinct shape allows them to fly through the water while they also can be to heavy and not float to well. Overall a surfboards size is the main factor to a better ride depending on what wave you're riding. But many experienced surfers prefr a smaller board due to it's ability to move faster on and off the waves and because it is more maneuverable on the waves.</p>
