    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>There are many different kind of beach breaks in the world. Beach breaks dontreally change, for example ifa beach has a shore break it will most likley always have a shore brea. Breaks don't changeoften or even ever at certain beach. Beach breaks are defined as how the wave breaks. This includes shorebreak and reef break plus the many more. These breaks not only shape the kind of wave it also determines the size of the wave. Making each beach unique in its own way. </p>

    <p>Overall the different breaks create different waves that havethere own pros and cons. Many people get hurt the most on shore break and reef break. This is because a reef break has a hard surfaceon the ground and shore break has big waves that crash in very shallow water. 1st and 2nd break can be confusing to some but it is actualy very simple. 1st and 2nd break usually occur in Hawaii this is when there are two breaks making the wave break twice. When it breaks the first time it's bigger and in deeper water but when it breaks a second time it is much smaller and in much more shallow water and usually has a better barrel.</p>

    <h2>What break is the best?</h2>
    <p>Depending on your skill level and which break you like best certain breaks will suit you better. For example if you are very skilled and can hold your breathe and can take a beating then shorebreak would bestsuit you. But if you like big waveriding and long paddle out then 2nd breaks will suit you best. Overall whichever break you pick the waves will be fun but in the end your getting thatwave sensation and having fun at the same time.</p>
