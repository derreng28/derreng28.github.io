    <p>These listed beaches are very popular to both the novice and the experienced surfer/body boarder. All of these beaches have dfferent styles of waves and breaks. These beaches are very popular to many surfers and body boarders but they have there dangers. There are many dangers especially at shore break beavhes such as the wedge and marine street. But we will get into the different dangers later. Also these beaches have different wave styles and sizes so different boards are needed.</p>
