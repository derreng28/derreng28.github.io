    <h2>Surfing</h2>
    <p class=".italic">Surfing, an experience you can't create. The feeling of floating on the water speeding down the face of a wave with nothing in front of you except water. Surfing relieves the stress od a daily life and lets you escape the stress of the world and just be one with the waves. There was a story that was once told about how surfing started and one of the best surfers to ever roam the waters and it went like this. "So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer. All they needed was, like, a piece of driftwood...a block of ice or something like that, and then they were off. And they were hooked, man. They were hooked. Up till recent times, you had your old dudes. Your hang-six cats. These old guys used to lay down with these huge, humongous boards. These guys were the pioneers...but nobody saw what surfing could really be...until Big Z did it. - Could you tell us who Big Z was? - Who was Big Z? You're asking the right guy. You got that far. Z is everything. Big Z is surfing. I mean, he's... There may well as not have been an ocean before Z. They invented the ocean for him. He lived so hard because he wasn't afraid to live. He wasn't afraid to die." </p>

    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>This website is an insight to the secertes of the beaches in southern California. I will explain the many things that you need to know about these beaches and the waves that these beaches have. For example you will need to know where they are located, what board to ride, paddle out distance and time, water depths, and the wave descriptions. There are very unique beaches in southern California, inckuding reef break and shre break which are very different waves and water depths.</p>

    <p>On this website I will also be going over not just surfing but body boarding as well. Body boarding and surf are similiar and different they are similiar because they both ride the wave similiar to each other. But they are different as well. For example on a surf board you stand up once you are on the wave, while on the body board you lay on you stomach or on occasion you can ride one your knees. The main differences between the two are the boards used and the position in which you are in. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing">Surfing Description Wiki</a></p>
